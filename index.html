     <h1 style="color:green;">How would i get this?</h1>
	  <p style="color:blue;">Oh, I think i finally did.</p>
	  <h3 style="color:yellow;">It's a multi colored webpage. That's why I'm using a black background.</h3>
	  <h2 style="color:grey;">What I'm doing is called internal styling</h2>
	  <p style="color:orange;">I finally did it.</p>
	  <p style="color:blue;">Below is a list of my favorite superheroes</p>
	  <ul>
	      <li style="color:purple;">My mum</li>
			<li style="color:red;">Flash</li>
			<li style="color:blue;">Superman(he's a bit overrated though)</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p style="color:yellow;">I love playing <span style="color:purple;">GAMES</span></p>
	  <p style="color:blue;">I used to play Pes on my PS3 until my PS3 just stopped working due to some error code</p>
	  <p style="color:green;">It's painful,right?</p>
	  <p style="color:white;">So I decided to play football games(PES) on my phone. After few months, PES had to release an update which will only work on 3gb ram phones but guess what? I use a 2gb ram phone!</p>
	  <p style="color:brown;">I felt bad. Really bad.But you know what they say, <span style="color:yellow;">WE MOVE.</span></p>
	  <p style="color:green;">Gaming is gradually moving away from mobiles to consoles and PCs. So i found out a game that suits me. That's the only game I play on my phone. I can't play games on my chroebook. It's less of a gaming machine.</p>
	  <p style="color:grey;">I can't remember the last time I played a football game. Hopefully, my mum should get me a Ps4 and a fifa 23 after reading this article.</p>
	  <h4 style="color:blue;">That's all for today.</h4>
	  <p style="color:purple;">OH! I almost forgot. Mum,after you read this, please show Mr. Tope. I'll appreciate reviews from both of you</p>
	  <h5 style="color:grey;">BYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!</h5>
